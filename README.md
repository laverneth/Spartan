Fast MultiLevel Solver for Laplacian Systems, under permissive MIT licence, feel free to use!
The hsc (hierarchical sparsify compensate) preconditioner is heavily based on the paper:
"Efficient Preconditioning of Laplacian Matrices for Computer Graphics"
by Dilip Krishnan and Raanan Fattal and Rick Szeliski
